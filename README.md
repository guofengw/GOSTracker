The project now has include levmar and freeglut, so you only need to set OpenCV path in the CMake.
The levmar is not built with lapack and blas , so the speed is not fast. 
If your system has lapack and blas, you can set HAVE_LAPACK 1, it will be more faster.

The test data can be found in the data folder
